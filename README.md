# Simple-WebMap-Folium
I's created using python and folium. What it does is it shows a map with: 
                          (i)base layer
                          (ii)polygon layer showing the population
                          (iii)marker layer showing the volcanoes in US.
                          
I have also added a control panel for each layer to toggle them ON/OFF.
